# What is this?

Good question Jon in the future.

I don't really understand Scala. I use it at work in Spark code, but that's it.
Whenever I think about Scala code, I think that it could probably just be written
in Java (they compile to the same bytecode!). It feels like a whitepaper language,
something used commercially due to the excess of 2010's VC hypetrain funding, and
FOMO driven development. All I really know about Scala is that it's been used in 
a bunch of data processing abstractions, that there's an actor model people 
pay for, and there's a million ways to do the same thing.

I want to develop an appreciation for what Scala is, and understand why it might
be beneficial for certain types of problems (or why not!).

I want to see if Scala and Java offer any differences in terms of developer
experience.

I want to see if I enjoy building things in Scala after a little on ramp

I'm timeboxing this work to the month - (ending 2024-10-06). I think that should
give me enough time to get an understanding of the foundations, and build some
sample programs
